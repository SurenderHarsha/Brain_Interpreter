# Brain_Interpreter
This is an interpreter for the Brain Language. It contains the basic 8 symbols in the language with an addition of 5 optional symbols that make the users life much easier. The option of adding more symbols and customizing the code is available as the code is very flexible. The code is available in c++ and Python.

Two People are working on the project.

B.Surender Harsha on the C++ version
and Shubham C on the Python Version.

The Python version of the program comes with a graphical interface and interactive visualised memory view.
The Python version is still under progress


The C++ version features 5 New Symbols which make programming a little bit less tedious and much more fun.


    1  '*'  -> The memory location at which the pointer is pointing to is incremented by 10. This is equivalent to ++++++++++ 
    2  '/'  -> The Memory location at which the pointer is pointing is decremented by 10. This is equivalent to ----------
    3  '^'  -> The Pointer in the memory quickly moves to the first position. equivalent to <<<<<<< so on
    4  '~'  -> A search begins from the beginning and the pointer stops at a cell whose value is zero.
    5  ';'  ->The Search begins and the pointer stops at the first non zero number.
    
The C++ version also provides some basic visualisation of the memory, the symbol being processed and the Character that is being read from the program.
